Scripts for visualising count-table normalisation

These are short scripts which aim to give a visual read-out of how well a particular dataset normalisation has worked.  Options include using a boxplot, a violin plot, or a frequency distribution plot, similar to that used in the Babraham Institute's 'SeqMonk' application.
